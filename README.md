FitArt
======

Idea:
------
Play games and make art with wearables


Execution:
----------

A very silly game with funky music

Currently, the Xcode project contains

half-done integration with Nod,

full integration with Jawbone API, 

complete assoc with a parse account

but actually uses the phone's accelerometer

and sends JSON data to firebase.

Usage:
------
Just open the app in foreground and tilt the phone.
